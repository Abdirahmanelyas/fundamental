Python Coding Assessment
This repository contains solutions for a Python coding assessment, evaluating key Python concepts like data structures, functions, decorators, and OOP.

Requirements
Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python installed.
IDE or Text Editor: Use your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text).
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Abdirahmanelyas/fundamental
# Download the code from GitHub.

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Python-Fundamentals
# Move to the project folder.

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python3 -m venv venv
# Set up a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

Activate the virtual environment:

Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
# Activate the virtual environment to use isolated settings.
Install dependencies:
None required
# No additional packages are needed for this project.

Running the Code
Execute the script:
python3 Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Python-Fundamentals
# Run the Python code to test the implemented functions.
Functions Implemented
add_numbers(num1, num2):
# Returns the sum of two numbers.

is_even(number):
# Returns True if the number is even, otherwise False.

reverse_string(text):
# Returns the reversed string.

count_vowels(text):
# Counts vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input string, case-insensitive.

calculate_factorial(n):
# Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer n.

apply_decorator(func):
# Applies a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

sort_by_age(people):
# Sorts a list of tuples (name, age) by age in ascending order.

merge_dicts(dict1, dict2):
