Python Coding Assessment
Overview
This repository contains solutions for a Python coding assessment designed to evaluate fundamental Python concepts, including data structures, functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your machine.
An IDE or text editor of your choice (such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text).
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

Clone the private repository to your local machine using the following command:
https://github.com/Abdirahmanelyas/fundamental
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Python-Fundamentals
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

To keep dependencies isolated, create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate
macOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

There are no external dependencies required for this project.

Running the Code
To run the code, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

python3 Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Python-Fundamentals
Functions Implemented
add_numbers(num1, num2): Returns the sum of two numbers.

is_even(number): Returns True if the input number is even, False otherwise.

reverse_string(text): Returns the reversed version of the input string.

count_vowels(text): Returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input string, ignoring case sensitivity.

calculate_factorial(n): Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer n.

apply_decorator(func): Applies a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

sort_by_age(people): Sorts a list of tuples containing names and ages by age in ascending order.

merge_dicts(dict1, dict2): Merges two dictionaries. If there are common keys, their values are summed up.
